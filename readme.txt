Simple keyboard shortcuts executor for Microsoft Windows.


HOW TO USE:
===========
First, you have to create configuration file. Default is "hotkey79.conf" or you can create one with another name and run "hotkey79.exe" with first parameter path to this file.

Configuration file definition is simple. Every line started with # is comment and is ignored. Every other line is one command definition. Structure is simple:

modifiers + key : command

Where modifiers can be "alt", "ctrl", "win" or "shift", all connected with "+" char. Key is one character like "a" or "r" or some key like "F11". You have to define both modifiers and key. And command is anything to run in Windows.

Example:

# run command line on Ctrl + Win + F12
Ctrl + Win + F12 : cmd.exe

After creating configation file, run "hotkey79.exe". This utility has no icon at taskbar. If you want to exit this utility, you have to use some task manager and manually kill the "hotkey79.exe" process. You have to do this also if you want to reload configuration.
